<p class="coding-exercise__desc" ng-bind-html="instructions" prettify=""><p>---<br>** Please read this entire page before attempting to solve this coding exercise.&nbsp; Additional help is available by watching the video mentioned at the bottom of the page **<br>---<br></p><p>Write a method named&nbsp;<strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit</strong>&nbsp;with one parameter of type <strong>int</strong> called&nbsp;number. <br><br>The method needs to find the first and last digit of the parameter&nbsp;number passed to the method, using a&nbsp;loop and return the sum of the first and last digit of that&nbsp;number.<br><br> If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.</p>

<p><strong>Example input/output</strong></p>





<p><strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit(252);&nbsp;</strong>should return 4, first digit is 2 and the&nbsp;last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the&nbsp;sum is 4.</p>





<p><strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit(257);&nbsp;</strong>should return 9, first digit is 2 and the&nbsp;last is 7 which gives us 2+7 and the&nbsp;sum is 9.</p>





<p><strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit(0);&nbsp;</strong>should return 0, first digit and the last digit is 0, since we only have 1 digit, which gives us 0+0 and the&nbsp;sum is 0.</p>





<p><strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit(5);&nbsp;</strong>should return 10, first digit and last digit is 5, since we only have 1 digit, which gives us 5+5 and the&nbsp;sum is 10.</p>





<p><strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit(-10);&nbsp;</strong>should return -1, because the parameter is negative and&nbsp;needs to be positive.</p>







<p><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>sumFirstAndLastDigit</strong>&nbsp;method&nbsp;needs to be defined as<strong>&nbsp;public static&nbsp;</strong>like we have been doing so far in the course.</p>





<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Do not add a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>m</strong><strong>ain&nbsp;</strong>method to solution code</p><p>--&nbsp;</p>

<p>NEED HELP?&nbsp; If you have not already watched video "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/10225902?start=0">Introduction To Coding Exercises</a>", make sure you do that before you attempt this or any other challenge.&nbsp; I show you how to go about solving a challenge, but also COMMON ERRORS you may get when attempting it.</p>

<p>Remember:&nbsp; You need to solve this coding exercise EXACTLY as stated.&nbsp; Using a different method name, or returning a different data type, even adding an extra space to&nbsp; information being printed out, or returned from a method will likely cause your solution to fail!</p>
