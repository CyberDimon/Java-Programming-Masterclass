<p>We have a dog that likes to bark.&nbsp; We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!</p>
<p>Write a method&nbsp;<strong>bark&nbsp;</strong>that has&nbsp;<strong>2 parameters.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1st parameter&nbsp;</strong>should be of type&nbsp;<strong>boolean&nbsp;</strong>and be named<strong>&nbsp;barking</strong>&nbsp;it represents if our dog is currently barking.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2nd parameter&nbsp;</strong>represents the&nbsp;<strong>hour of the day</strong>&nbsp;and is of type int with the name hourOfDay and has valid range of&nbsp;<strong>0-23</strong>.</p>
<p>We have to wake up if the dog&nbsp;is barking before 08:00 am or after 22:00 hours so in that case return&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all other cases return false. If the hourOfDay parameter is&nbsp;<strong>less than 0</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>greater than 23</strong>&nbsp;return&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of input/output:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>bark(true, 1);</strong>&nbsp;should return true</li>
    <li><strong>bark(false, 2);</strong>&nbsp;should return false since the dog is not barking.</li>
    <li><strong>bark(true, 8);</strong>&nbsp;should return false, since it's not before 8:00AM.</li>
    <li><strong>bark(true, -1);</strong>&nbsp;should return false because the hourOfDay parameter needs to be in range 0-23.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong>&nbsp;Use an if else statement with multiple conditions.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>bark</strong>&nbsp;method&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to be defined as<strong>&nbsp;public static&nbsp;</strong>like we have been doing so far in the course.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Do not add a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>m</strong><strong>ain&nbsp;</strong>method to solution code.</p>

<p>NEED HELP?&nbsp; If you have not already watched video "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/10225902?start=0">Introduction To Coding Exercises</a>", make sure you do that before you attempt this or any other challenge.&nbsp; I show you how to go about solving a challenge, but also COMMON ERRORS you may get when attempting it.</p>
<p>Remember:&nbsp; You need to solve this coding exercise EXACTLY as stated.&nbsp; Using a different method name, or returning a different data type, even adding an extra space to&nbsp; information being printed out, or returned from a method will likely cause your solution to fail!&nbsp;</p>
