<div class="coding-exercise__statement__content__inner"> <h2 class="coding-exercise__title">Number In Word</h2> <p class="coding-exercise__desc" ng-bind-html="instructions" prettify=""><p>---<br>** Please read this entire page before attempting to solve this coding exercise.&nbsp; Additional help is available by watching the video mentioned at the bottom of the page **<br>---<br></p><p>Write a method called <strong>printNumberInWord.</strong></p>

    <p>This method should have&nbsp;one parameter called number which a&nbsp;whole&nbsp;number (type int).<br><br>The method needs to print&nbsp;<strong>"ZERO" </strong>if the number parameter is passed with the value of 0.<br>The method needs to print&nbsp;<strong>"ONE"&nbsp;</strong>if the number parameter is&nbsp;passed with the value of&nbsp;1.<br>The method needs to print&nbsp;<strong>"TWO"&nbsp;</strong>if the number parameter is&nbsp;passed with the value of&nbsp;2.<br></p>





    <p>... and so on up to and including <strong>"NINE"</strong> if the number parameter is passed with the value of 9.</p>





    <p>If the&nbsp;number parameter has any other value than 0 to 9, then the method should print <strong>"OTHER".</strong></p>





    <p>You can use an&nbsp;if-else statement or a the switch statement to solve this challenge - the choice is yours.<br><br><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>printNumberInWord</strong>&nbsp;method&nbsp;needs to be defined as<strong>&nbsp;public static&nbsp;</strong>like we have been doing so far in the course.&nbsp;<br></p>







    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Do not add a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>m</strong><strong>ain&nbsp;</strong>method to solution code.</p><p>--&nbsp;</p>

    <p>NEED HELP?&nbsp; If you have not already watched video "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/10225902?start=0">Introduction To Coding Exercises</a>", make sure you do that before you attempt this or any other challenge.&nbsp; I show you how to go about solving a challenge, but also COMMON ERRORS you may get when attempting it.</p>

    <p>Remember:&nbsp; You need to solve this coding exercise EXACTLY as stated.&nbsp; Using a different method name, or returning a different data type, even adding an extra space to&nbsp; information being printed out, or returned from a method will likely cause your solution to fail!</p>
