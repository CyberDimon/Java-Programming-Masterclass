<p class="coding-exercise__desc" ng-bind-html="instructions" prettify=""><p>---<br>** Please read this entire page before attempting to solve this coding exercise.&nbsp; Additional help is available by watching the video mentioned at the bottom of the page **<br>---<br></p><p>Write a method <strong>isLeapYear&nbsp;</strong>with a parameter of type int named&nbsp;<strong>year</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    The parameter needs to be&nbsp;<strong>greater than or equal to 1</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;less than or equal to 9999</strong>.</p>









<p>

    If the&nbsp;parameter is not in that range return&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>.&nbsp;</p>









<p>
    Otherwise, if it is in the valid range,&nbsp;calculate if the year is a leap year and return&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;if it is, otherwise return&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>.&nbsp;</p>









<p>
    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.</p>









<p><strong>Examples of input/output:</strong></p>













<ul><li><strong>isLeapYear(-1600);</strong>&nbsp;should return false since parameter is not in the&nbsp;range (1-9999)</li><li><strong>isLeapYear(1600);</strong>&nbsp;should return true since 1600 is leap year</li><li><strong>isLeapYear(2017);</strong>&nbsp;should return false since 2017 is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;a leap year</li><li><strong>isLeapYear(2000);</strong>&nbsp;should return true because 2000 is a leap year&nbsp;</li></ul>













<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong><strong>isLeapYear</strong></strong>&nbsp;method&nbsp;needs to be defined as<strong>&nbsp;public static&nbsp;</strong>like we have been doing so far in the course.&nbsp;<br><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Do not add a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>m</strong><strong>ain&nbsp;</strong>method to solution code.</p><p>--</p><p>
    NEED HELP?&nbsp; If you have not already watched video "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/10225902?start=0">Introduction To Coding Exercises</a>", make sure you do that before you attempt this or any other challenge.&nbsp; I show you how to go about solving a challenge, but also COMMON ERRORS you may get when attempting it.</p>

<p>Remember:&nbsp; You need to solve this coding exercise EXACTLY as stated.&nbsp; Using a different method name, or returning a different data type, even adding an extra space to&nbsp; information being printed out, or returned from a method will likely cause your solution to fail!&nbsp;</p><p>---</p></p>
