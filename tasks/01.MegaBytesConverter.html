<p>Write a method called&nbsp;<strong>printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes</strong>&nbsp;that has 1 parameter of type int with the name&nbsp;<strong>kiloBytes</strong>.</p>
<p>The method should not return anything (<strong>void</strong>) and it needs to calculate the megabytes and remaining kilobytes from the kilobytes parameter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it needs to print a message in the format<strong>&nbsp;"XX KB = YY MB and ZZ KB"</strong>. <strong>XX</strong>&nbsp;represents the original value&nbsp;<strong>kiloBytes</strong>. <strong>YY&nbsp;</strong>represents the calculated&nbsp;<strong>megabytes</strong>. <strong>ZZ&nbsp;</strong>represents the calculated&nbsp;<strong>remaining kilobytes</strong>.</p>
<p>If the parameter&nbsp;<strong>kiloBytes</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>&lt; 0</strong>&nbsp;then print instead the text&nbsp;<strong>"Invalid Value"</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Example: printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(2050) should print "2050 KB = 2 MB and 2 KB"</li>
    <li>TIP: Be careful about&nbsp;<strong>spaces</strong>&nbsp;in the printed message.</li>
    <li>TIP: Use the remainder operator</li>
    <li>TIP: 1 MB = 1024 KB</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong><strong>printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes</strong></strong>&nbsp;method&nbsp;needs to be defined as<strong>&nbsp;public static&nbsp;</strong>like we have been doing so far in the course.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Do not add a <strong>m</strong><strong>ain&nbsp;</strong>method to solution code.</p>

<p>NEED HELP? If you have not already watched video "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/10225902?start=0">Introduction To Coding Exercises</a>", make sure you do that before you attempt this or any other challenge. I show you how to go about solving a challenge, but also COMMON ERRORS you may get when attempting it.</p>
<p>Remember: You need to solve this coding exercise EXACTLY as stated. Using a different method name, or returning a different data type, even adding an extra space to information being printed out, or returned from a method will likely cause your solution to fail!&nbsp;</p>
